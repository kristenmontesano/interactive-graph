# interactive-graph

This app is an interactive visualization of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on a graph. It allows users to select a start and end node and then visually demonstrates the path BFS takes to reach the end node from the start node, along with how many nodes were visited to find the end node.

### How to Use
1. The app loads with a predefined graph
2. Select a start node and an end node from the dropdowns
3. Click the 'Start BFS' button to begin the BFS traversal animation
4. Watch as the BFS explores the graph, animating the path it takes
5. Once the animation completes, the 'Reset' button appears; click it to reset the graph and try again with different start and end nodes
